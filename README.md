# CMEGradChallenge
Technical Challenge for CME Grad Recruitment process

Assumptions made
 - I have made the assumption that the output of the program should have the format "The Prime numbers in this sequence are: [2, 3, 5, 23]"
 - I Have my logger configured to print to the command line instead of a log file
 - I have included tests, though I did not know how to test the PrimeCheckerService class on time - This is something I would like to revisit

How to run
 - The application is using Java 17 with maven
 - Dependencies installed are
    - Log4j-api
    - Log4j-core
    - junit
    - mockito-core (though this was not used by the time of submission)
